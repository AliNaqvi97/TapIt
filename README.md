# TapIt
Source Code for my first Android app: Tap It!

I wrote this back near the end of 2015 (Never put it on Github until 2017) as my first ever Android app, trying to play around and 
see what I could put together. Not actively updating it (besides to clean up/improve code as I have learned more since then) so it is not
a WIP as far as new features/big updates and such.
